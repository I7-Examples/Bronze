# Bronze

_Here is some useful information from the Bronze manual._

## About the Making of _Bronze_

_Bronze_ was written in part as a demonstration of Inform 7, a programming language created by Graham Nelson for interactive fiction. The annotated source code and design diary for Bronze are available online, and may be of interest to anyone who would like to try his hand at writing interactive fiction.

This game would also not have been possible without the efforts of its beta-testing team; for a complete set of credits, accurate for the latest version, consult the menu in the game.

We have of course done our best to stomp out problems, but if you do find any errors, feel free to contact the author (Emily Short, emshort@mindspring.com) to report them (and earn your own place in the testing credits...).

## Distribution

While _Bronze_ remains copyright of its author, anyone is welcome to make copies and distribute them freely, in physical or electronic form, without charge, as long as the following conditions are met:

You may not alter the game or remove the authorship attribution.

You may not distribute the game for profit without the authorâ€™s explicit written permission. Charging a fee to cover physical media or shipping is acceptable.

Notifying the author before including _Bronze_ in any compilations would be a welcome courtesy, but not required.
