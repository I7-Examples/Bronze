Originally the map was ordinary scenery and the candle had no effect on it, but one or two testers got stuck not realizing that the summoned candle was portable. This seemed like a way to nudge players to try moving the candle -- and perhaps then to make the leap that they could also take it down into the dark rooms.</span></p>
