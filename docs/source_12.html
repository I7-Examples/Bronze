The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It is not as though you would understand the language in which they are written.</span>&quot; The great contract book is a thing in the Law Library. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">contracts</span>&quot; as the contract book. The description of the great contract book is &quot;<span class="quote">A book many thousands of pages long, and on each page is a name, a birthdate, a term of service, all the contracts that bind the castle's ghosts and servitors and Powers: ostlers and fighting-men, bishops and whores.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The books of precedent are scenery in the law library. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">There are too many for you to read even if you took a long time at it, and most are written in unfamiliar languages.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of attacking or cutting the contract book:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">It proves most resistant to any physical assault.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">Stands to reason it wouldn't be that easy, of course.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of burning the contract book when the player carries the candle:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">You hold the candle to the book; the flame licks the pages cheerily and gleams on the gilding of the marginal illuminations -- some of those early contracts are quite fancy. But the fire does not harm the parchment at all, or even darken it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of consulting the great contract book about a topic listed in the Table of Contracts List:</p><p class="indent1">if the player is not in the Translation Room, continue the action;</p><p class="indent1">if the player cannot see the candle, continue the action; </p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">reply entry</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">After printing the name of a ringer (called target): </p><p class="indent1">if the target is in Storage-Box:</p><p class="indent2">if the number of ringers in Storage-Box is greater than 3 and the Bellroom is visited:</p><p class="indent3">say &quot;<span class="quote"> (come to think of it, haven't you seen that...?)</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent2">move the target to the Bellroom;</p><p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Table of Contracts List</span></p><table><tr><td><span class="columnhead">topic</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">reply</span></td></tr>

But the contract below, which stipulates your eternal imprisonment here, has been amended with a permission to leave and return within seven days. Then: 'Guarantor of this exchange: the king of the castle and all his rights and servants.' Which means that if you had not returned, the Beast would have been forfeit and all the servants as well.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

From comparison to some of the other contracts, you see that it would have been easy service indeed, no manual labor but only companionship to the king, and no command-bell to make him come or go.</span></p><span class="quote">But the contract has been amended in a small neat hand that says: 'Voided in voluntary exchange for his daughter's service.'

These all occur towards the end of the book, shortly before your own.</span></p><span class="quote">In fact, this is the very last contract recorded before your father's and yours: a young woman named Yvette, brought to the castle -- though she was betrothed to a lord already -- to 'serve' the king. You have the impression that the contract book is leaving out a good deal, such as why Yvette was associated with the girdle, and what she was doing here.
