The description of the Black Gallery is &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if the number of things in the Black Gallery is less than 3</span><span class="quote">]Rather bare compared with its former glory[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]Lined with [</span><span class="substitution">neat rows</span><span class="quote">] of inscrutable -- one might almost say pointless -- objects[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The inkpot is a fluid container in the Black Gallery. It is empty. Instead of examining the inkpot for the first time, say &quot;<span class="quote">A [</span><span class="substitution">very</span><span class="quote">]curious object.</span>&quot;. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">An inkpot of dark material. [</span><span class="substitution">if the inkpot is empty</span><span class="quote">]Inside there remains only a red-black crust of dried ink[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]It is full almost to the brim with red-black ink[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; Before printing the name of the examined inkpot: say &quot;<span class="quote">infernal </span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">[The Black Gallery is a different take on the Bellroom situation. In the Bellroom, we tell the player there are a variety of objects present, but move specific ones in only as he finds out about their existence. In the Black Gallery, we put all the objects in together, hinting strongly that they are all (or almost all) red herrings, and let him pick out the one that is actually useful.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">To prevent it from being too obvious which the player wants, we need the inkpot to fall at a random place in the description (not necessarily the beginning or the end); and for added fun we will a) discourage examination of every single object individually; and b) randomize the arrangement of items in the room description to make it harder to work through them in order.]</span></p><p class="indent0">The Black Gallery contains a white apple, a stuffed boar, a preserved goat, a cane, a glass leaf, a silver buckle, a copper snake, a homunculus, a parrot perch, a green cloth swatch, a dark-colored pendant, a gold ring, a broken beam. The ring and the pendant are wearable. The apple is edible. The boar, the goat, the beam, and the perch are fixed in place. <a name="note1ref"></a><span class="notecue"><a href="#note1">[1]</a></span> Understand &quot;<span class="quote">swordstick</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">handle</span>&quot; as the cane. Before turning or pulling or opening the cane: say &quot;<span class="quote">You don't quite have the knack to release the sword, if indeed this is a swordstick.</span>&quot; instead. Instead of tasting the white apple: say &quot;<span class="quote">You lick the flavorless skin to no effect.</span>&quot; After eating the white apple: say &quot;<span class="quote">A little apprehensively, you eat the white apple -- which is to all appearances harmless, but has no flavor at all; as if this had been drained away with its color.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of taking a fixed in place curious thing in the Black Gallery, say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">The noun</span><span class="quote">] is too heavy for you to lift.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">A thing has some text called elaboration.

The elaboration of the glass leaf is &quot;<span class="quote">(very fragile)</span>&quot;.

<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  Since we are just coming up with a supply of random strange objects, many of these things are objects from other games. The beam is a nod to the useless but heavy beam from Zork.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  We could do this individually, but this initialization is quicker to code and easier to change on the fly.</span></p>
<p><a name="note3"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note3ref">[3]</a>.  We don't make them scenery because that would exclude them automatically from TAKE ALL.</span></p>
