You have walked it many times, seeking to waste the excesses of time at your disposal.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Walk's End is east of the Cloister Walk and southeast of Rose Garden. &quot;<span class="quote">Lucrezia, they say, died here. It is only a turning point in the corridor, with a bench.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">The stone bench is an enterable supporter in Walk's End. It is scenery. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">curious</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">relief</span>&quot; as the bench. The description of the stone bench is &quot;<span class="quote">A deep seat with a curious relief carved onto the back: if you look from the right angle, it appears as though Lucrezia is lying on the bench, just like a lady on a tomb, her hands piously folded around the handle of a mirror. Scrying her own death, perhaps, or maybe communicating with someone who had already died.</span>&quot; Instead of pushing or turning the stone bench: say &quot;<span class="quote">If the Beast were awake and here, you might between you be able to budge the stone bench; but as it is, you haven't much chance.</span>&quot; Before pushing the stone bench to a direction: try pushing the stone bench instead. After entering the bench, say &quot;<span class="quote">You settle uneasily onto the bench, recalling its ghostly former user.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">On the stone bench is some discarded embroidery materials. The materials are a reminder. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">linen</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">basket</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">threads</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">thread</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">cloth</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">fabric</span>&quot; as the materials. The description of the embroidery is &quot;<span class="quote">The little that is already done is old-fashioned blackwork, like your grandmother's mother might have stitched.</span>&quot; The memory of the embroidery is &quot;<span class="quote">A few weeks ago now, he came to you with a quick step. 'Look, it took me all morning, but I found this.' Holding out the basket of threads, the folded linen. Not in bad condition, either.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'What is that for?' You were never much for sewing things at home, even before your mother died.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'I thought -- since you're so bored here --' He lowered his arm. 'When I saw more of the world, I knew a number of young ladies who were very fond of it. My sister liked to make stories with hers.'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You opened your mouth, looking for something to say.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'I see,' he answered. 'The world has changed. What do young ladies do now?'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'I don't know,' you reply. 'My father fell on hard times. We live in the country. I'm more or less a milkmaid, these days.'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">At the word milkmaid, his mouth twisted a little and he shrugged.

"Unbolts" comes from the Locksmith extension, and indicates that the player *knows* that the key fits this door, so even at the beginning of the game the small key will be described in inventory as opening the small door.</span></p>
