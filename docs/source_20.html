<br>

<br>
The Dank Room is dark. The description of the Dank Room is &quot;<font color=#000080>The air is clammy and unpleasant, and clogs in your lungs.</font>&quot; Instead of smelling the Dank Room: say &quot;<font color=#000080>It is even less pleasant than Lucrezia's rose garden, and that is saying something.</font>&quot;  
<br>

<br>
The Press Room is north of the Dank Room. The Press Room is dark. &quot;<font color=#000080>Liquid squeezed from the surrounding earth here flows out through [a fountain], then soaks back into the ground below.</font>&quot;  The fountain is scenery in press room. The description of the fountain is &quot;<font color=#000080>The liquid is sludge-black where it pours in quantity, but where it runs thin, it appears red.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>liquid</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>trickling</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>dull</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>ink</font>&quot; as the fountain. The sound of the fountain is &quot;<font color=#000080>dull trickling</font>&quot;. Instead of touching the fountain: say &quot;<font color=#000080>It feels a little warmer and a little stickier than it ought.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of filling the vial in the presence of the fountain: say &quot;<font color=#000080>The vial is stoppered and full of the old poison; and in any case who knows how the liquid here would interact with the apothecary's brew? Better to find some other container.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of filling an empty fluid container in the presence of fountain: now the noun is full; say &quot;<font color=#000080>You fill [the noun] from [the fountain], trying to get as little as possible on yourself.</font>&quot; Instead of filling a full fluid container: say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] is already full.</font>&quot; Instead of smelling the fountain: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Despite its unappealing appearance and the rankness of the air, it does not smell as vile as you expect: more bitter.</font>&quot; The scent of the fountain is &quot;<font color=#000080>bitterness</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Instead of drinking or tasting the fountain: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Overcoming dislike, you taste a bit of the liquid, and find it more bitter than wormwood. All anguish and regret and the knowledge that it was once in your own power to make things come out better. But perhaps it is not too late after all.</font>&quot;
