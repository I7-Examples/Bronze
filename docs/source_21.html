Tight Passage is dark. &quot;<span class="quote">The passage through rock ends here, and begins to tunnel through soil instead where it heads northeast.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The cord is a fixed in place thing in Tight Passage. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">A pullcord emerges from the rock just before the walls of the passage turn to mud.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">pullcord</span>&quot; as the cord. Instead of taking the cord, try pulling the cord. Instead of pulling the cord: say &quot;<span class="quote">You give the cord a hard yank. Somewhere above you a very deep bell tolls.</span>&quot;; now the Parliamentary Chambers are active; summons runs out in 7 turns from now. Instead of pulling the cord when the Parliamentary Chambers are active: say &quot;<span class="quote">Instead of the expected toll, there is only a muted thunk -- perhaps you cannot use the bell too many times in too short a period.</span>&quot; Instead of pulling the cord when the sinister door is unlocked: say &quot;<span class="quote">No need to trouble him again.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">A room can be active or still. At the time when summons runs out: now the Parliamentary Chambers are still.</p><p class="indent0"> </p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Instead of waiting when the location is Parliamentary Chambers and Parliamentary Chambers are active and the sinister door is locked:</p><p class="indent1">now the sinister door is unlocked; now the sinister door is open;</p><p class="indent1">now the Parliamentary Chambers are still;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">There is a scuffle, and a presence unfolds itself from where it was waiting, unseen, on the benches. It comes towards you and circles you, and you have the idea -- more imagination than eyesight -- that this was once a tall, thin man of considerable power.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">It says a few words in the bastardized Italian of the state of Medici-Credenza, and you hear the scrape of wood and stone from somewhere below you: a door opening. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">Then the presence vanishes.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The inscription is a fixed in place thing in Tight Passage. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">lettering</span>&quot; as the inscription. The printing of the inscription is &quot;<span class="quote">Pull this cord, then wait in the room directly above to speak with Lucrezia's steward. Do not let more than five minutes pass between the summons and the waiting, or he will depart again without offering aid.</span>&quot; Instead of rubbing or touching the inscription, say &quot;<span class="quote">Try though you might to discover its meaning by touch, the letters are too small and numerous for you to read that way; only the capitals P, L, and D stand out. L for Lucrezia, maybe? The word does feel long enough.</span>&quot; The description of the inscription is &quot;<span class="quote">There's lettering beneath the pullcord.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The inscription can be unknown, partially known, or fully revealed.
