You can only guess at why, or by whom.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But the dominant item is the vast [</span><span class="substitution">image</span><span class="quote">] of Lucrezia at a wardrobe fitting of some kind.</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The sinister door is west of the Tight Passage. It is a door. It is locked and lockable and closed. The description of the sinister door is &quot;<span class="quote">The work of the hinges and handle, the color of the wood, the point of the arch: all malevolent. It does not have a keyhole at all, however, and looks far too sturdy to succumb to battering. In fact, by the looks of it, someone has had a try before.</span>&quot; Instead of attacking a locked sinister door: say &quot;<span class="quote">It is just as resistant to attack as it looks.</span>&quot;  The initial appearance of the sinister door is &quot;<span class="quote">There is also a sinister door, leading [</span><span class="substitution">if the location is the Tight Passage</span><span class="quote">]west[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]east[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">if the sinister door is open</span><span class="quote">] -- and currently open[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The pile of notes is in the study. &quot;<span class="quote">A single [</span><span class="substitution">pile of notes</span><span class="quote">] remains.</span>&quot; The description of the pile of notes is &quot;<span class="quote">Spiky, erratic handwriting on a variety of mystical and magical topics pertaining to the castle and the spiritual status of the inhabitants.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">paper</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">papers</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">note</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">paperwork</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">single</span>&quot; as the papers.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Instead of consulting the notes about a topic listed in the Table of Notes: </p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">reply entry</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Table of Notes</span></p><table><tr><td><span class="columnhead">topic</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">reply</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">rose/roses/garden</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">rose garden</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The roses are of Lucrezia's own breeding, and you have the impression she regarded them in the nature of a practical joke.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">mirrors/scrying/scry/mirror/mirror-scrying</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">There are various records of the conferences Lucrezia had with various friends, family members, and servants, by ringing bells in the presence of her magical mirrors.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">lucrezia</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Though the notes are of her writing, they are for the most part not about her: she was not a diarist, but an experimenter.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">me/myself</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">There's nothing about you here, which is no surprise, considering that the author of these pages was dead centuries before your arrival.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">beast</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">You can discover no specific references to the Beast; though your hazy impression from his conversation is that he never knew Lucrezia, she having been generations before him.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">father</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">my father</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Your father is not mentioned, which should not surprise, since he did not arrive at the castle until a few years ago, and the papers look to be centuries old.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">elzibad</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Lucrezia seems to have been quite interested in Elzibad, or rather, in what happened to the castle after Elzibad's death, when contracts were made binding upon all who entered. But there is nothing in her notes to suggest that she had access to sources beyond the papers in the records room, and therefore you are likely to be able to find out all the same yourself, if you wish.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">girdle</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">green girdle</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">You sift through the papers until you find a pertinent entry: that the girdle is to be in some way a device for the punishment or forgiveness of those who abuse the castle's power, 'being in the possession of the weakest of its victims'. Accompanying this are a bundle of astrological diagrams, so who knows how reliable that may be thought to be.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">inkpot</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">About the inkpot, the notes are their most cryptic, and the quality of the handwriting has also declined so that you suspect the author of having been either elderly or sick. 'Of this article, which my father gave me, I believe I have finally uncovered some use. For though it will not hold ink of the ordinary kind, it perfectly contains that which flows beneath the burial ground, consisting of the regret of all inhabitants...' Etc., etc.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">press room</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">fountain</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">ink</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">There are references to an ink of regret -- this sounds romantic, except that the notes go on at tedious length speculating on the precise combination of humors involved, and whether melancholy or blood has the greater part in it, and so on. In any case, Lucrezia seemed quite pleased to have found a source of this valuable, if rather nauseating, liquid.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">helmet</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The helmet turns out to be written up at great length: an object of Lucrezia's own creation though produced with her father's assistance, it apparently it draws upon the daemons of air and sound to produce the rather mundane effect of heightened hearing, and poses no threat to the wearer, even if that wearer is merely an ordinary human. (This is underlined several times, leading you to suspect that most of Lucrezia's test subjects did not fall into that unexciting category.)</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">shoe/shoes/cloven</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">cloven shoes</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">pair of shoes</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">pair of cloven shoes</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The shoes, according to these pages, symbolize their wearer's right to tread in and be master of the territory of the dead.</span></p><span class="quote"></span></p><span class="quote">'For which reason I wear them always to funerals and in graveyards', remark the notes conversationally, 'the which habit has greatly offended some of the noble ladies through the cause of the shoes not being a suitable color for such occasions.' Before you can build up much sympathy, Lucrezia continues: 'Therefore in recompense I enslaved two of these ladies to my personal service and gave a third to my son to be his concubine until better manners and humility attend them all.'</span></p><span class="quote"></span></p><span class="quote">Some additional function for the shoes is suggested by the papers -- something about the preservation of memory or a connection to those who wore them previously -- but it seems that even Lucrezia did not understand this very well. ('And for this reason I am determined never to let them fall into the hands of another, but to have them burnt on my pyre at the moment of my death, lest those that follow after learn my secrets.') That scheme didn't work out for her, evidently.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">leather tambourine</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">tambourine/shoemaker/cobbler</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The shoemaker so busily fitting Lucrezia in the portrait does not seem to have been sufficiently interesting to warrant a record in these notes, though perhaps the terms of his engagement will be found in the contract book.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">devil/mephistopheles/lucifer/satan/compact/curse</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">References to the devil are scattered throughout the pages, with no one portion devoted to him entirely. Somewhat to your surprise, Lucrezia does not seem to have been an ardent fan of the Old Gentleman, neither a professed witch nor a worshipper at his court; she was merely interested in a pragmatic, legalistic way in the question of whether his compact with the ruling family of this castle could ever be dissolved, with or without the damnation of all parties.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">quill/pen</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">About the pen there is a considerable raving: 'Many tests of fire, water, pressure, torsion, acid, and poison have failed; even gunpowder and holy water have not sufficed to ruin it; nor do I now believe that it can be destroyed, but suppose that, being plucked from the wing of the old man my father, it partakes of his same eternal nature. Therefore the arrangement must be dissolved in some other way.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">lie library</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The Lie Library features in her writings at several points: as an ongoing project of which she sometimes has great hopes, sometimes despair; there are assorted references to experiments in bringing various books and ensconcing them there in order to see what will become of them. There are towards the end some excited speculations about the use of the inkpot in combination with the Lie Library, but it is not clear that she lived long enough to make the experiment.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">contracts/contract/crypt/binding</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">book of contracts</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">contract/contracts book</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">ivory door</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Mostly some speculative notes about the possibility of voiding contracts through some loophole of demonic legalism. You don't entirely follow it. At any rate, to judge by this, she had obtained a kind of mastery over the crypt-spirits by use of her magic shoes. And there is also a reference to a room upstairs, behind the ivory door.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">castle</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">royal family</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">husband</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">king</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Whenever she writes about her family or her husband, it is with a kind of weary exasperation. You have the sense that none of them were-- or seemed to be-- nearly as intelligent as Lucrezia herself, and she therefore protected and despised them.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">hourglass/dayglass/sand</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">From the notes you have the impression that Lucrezia understood the function of the hourglass and expected that everyone else did also; therefore, maddeningly, she did not record it. But it seems merely to be a measure of something, not a source of power or control.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">sign/warning</span>&quot;</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">According to the notes, Lucrezia insisted that the sign be made more prominent, in order that no one break their contract by accident.</span>&quot; </td></tr>
