One is to be sure that someone who enters the basement with a candle does see everything available -- some testers were going down through the Bear Corridor, getting stuck entering the crypt, and not coming around to explore from the Rose Garden side, which meant they got stuck. While it might arguably be fair to make them think of that in a more difficult game, *this* one is pitched to be less challenging. So we connect up the subterranean space this way. The other reason is that I just thought the idea of the bell-making equipment evocative, and wanted to plant this idea in the player's head that this industry has been going on for a very very long time.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Bell Castings is south of the Rooted Room. &quot;<span class="quote">A room of [</span><span class="substitution">scrap</span><span class="quote">] and refuse: wooden structures and clay molds from which bells might be made, scrap metal, pieces of bells now broken.</span>&quot; The scrap is scenery in castings.
