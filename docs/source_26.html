There are bells large and small, clappers, tambourines, and gongs. Most of these you have never seen used at all.</span>&quot; The bell collection is scenery in the Bellroom.

Understand &quot;<span class="quote">gong</span>&quot; as the bell collection when the bronze gong is not visible. Instead of searching the bell collection: say &quot;<span class="quote">There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of these bells; you could not hope to enumerate them all. Some are so old and dusty, in the back ranks, that they cannot have been used in centuries.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The north window is a backdrop. It is in the Bellroom and the Apothecary. It is not scenery.

She looks at you with plain curiosity.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">'So you're the one?' she asks. 'Did you know that he carried me over the drawbridge into the castle, and made me slave to his wishes even though I was betrothed to another? and that for the breach of contract my father died impoverished?'</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">You say nothing. You have not known him to be like that; but many human lifetimes have passed since Yvette was alive.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">She shrugs one shoulder. 'If you can love such a creature, then I will leave the green girdle for you on my grave; you come take it and kiss him,' she says. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">Then she fades from view.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Instead of attacking the silver bell when candle is in Storage:</p><p class="indent1">if the location is not the Translation Room, continue the action;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">The silver bell</span><span class="quote">] rings once in triumph, and the room springs to brilliant light.</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">The bell itself fades back to its usual place.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">move silver bell to Bellroom;</p><p class="indent1">move candle to the Translation Room. </p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The description of the Apothecary is &quot;<span class="quote">Furnished with [</span><span class="substitution">a long countertop</span><span class="quote">] and the equipment of an apothecary; sketches from physicians; [</span><span class="substitution">anatomical drawings</span><span class="quote">] of creatures similar to the Beast, bears and lions being especially prominent; also [</span><span class="substitution">poison reference books</span><span class="quote">], primarily the work of Italian and (earlier) Persian experts. The room has an unused air, and you do not remember ever coming in before, or seeing the Beast go in. It must have been a hobby that interested him before your arrival.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The long countertop is scenery in the Apothecary. It is a supporter. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The countertop has water stains and the occasional burn on it.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">table</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">counter</span>&quot; as the countertop.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The equipment is scenery on the countertop. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Delicate scales and glass bottles, blades and mortars and drying racks and other things you do not recognize.</span>&quot; Instead of doing something when the equipment must be touched, say &quot;<span class="quote">The conviction that these recently contained powerful contact poisons makes you reluctant to handle them in any way.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">To decide whether (item - a thing) must be touched:</p><p class="indent1">if the item is the noun and the action requires a touchable noun, yes;</p><p class="indent1">if the item is the second noun and the action requires a touchable second noun, yes;</p><p class="indent1">no.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Some poison reference books are scenery in the Apothecary. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Assorted disturbing recipes for ways to make your enemies die quickly, or to dispatch them slowly in great pain. The pages most discolored by use and splashed ingredients are those pertaining to swift and pleasant execution.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">book</span>&quot; as the reference books. Instead of taking the reference books, say &quot;<span class="quote">There are too many of them to carry around, and besides, you lack the skill to concoct poison, even if you wanted to.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The anatomical drawings are scenery in the Apothecary. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">drawing</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">diagram</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">bears</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">lions</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">sketches</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">sketch</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">digestive tract</span>&quot; as the drawings.
