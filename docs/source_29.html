<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'You can leave at any time,' he said, when he first spoke to you. You stared at him, surprised that someone with his face and teeth was capable of human communication. 'Would you like to go?'</span></p><span class="quote">There are other memories, more recent, of course. Every glance around the room reminds you of a different one.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I'm surprised you haven't gone home yet,' he said very early in your stay.</span></p><span class="quote">'I've heard stories,' you replied. 'As if there weren't enough to see around the castle. I know what happens to your servants who try to leave you.'</span></p><span class="quote">'Nothing bad would happen to you,' he said. But you could not believe him, not with all the captured spirits, not with the stories, not with the evidence around the castle.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'And now -- would you like to go home?'</span></p><span class="quote">You bit your lip. It had been a pleasant conversation, up until now, when you are reminded: however nicely he may behave, he is still the king of a cursed line, and not to be trusted.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I assure you,' he added. 'No harm will come to you if you do go.'</span></p><span class="quote">'I only have your word for that,' you replied, looking stubbornly into your soupbowl.</span></p><span class="quote">He sat. 'I am unable to lie to you,' he said. 'It is one of the conditions placed upon us. We can only tell the truth.'</span></p><span class="quote">'And why should I believe that?'</span></p><span class="quote">He raised his glass. 'I'll try again tomorrow.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Were you ever married?' you asked, ignoring his question.</span></p><span class="quote">'No.'</span></p><span class="quote">'Then you have no heirs?'</span></p><span class="quote">'I have no legitimate sons,' he replied. 'But I certainly have an heir, somewhere. If I died, somewhere, someone would inherit all this, and the whole system would go on as before, the servants and the contracts. But don't worry: I have tried, and it turns out that I don't die easily.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'And you promise I would not regret it? Truthfully.'</span></p><span class="quote">He coughed. 'I don't know your future. And -- since you ask I must answer -- I don't think much of your father, a man who would barter his daughter's service for his own, especially since he had unflattering ideas of what I would do with you.'</span></p><span class="quote">You sputtered. 'Well of course you couldn't-- I mean, being an animal...'</span></p><span class="quote">His teeth gleamed. 'I assure you I could,' he said. 'But I won't.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I have become used to it here,' you answered, surprising yourself. 'There is plenty to read; there is the chessman, and games; and you are good company.' He raised his glass with a half smile. 'You'd rather stay here without me?'</span></p><span class="quote">'No,' he said.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'I c-care for you,' you said. 'I am lonely without you, and you make me laugh, and you're nice...'</span></p><span class="quote">'Stop,' he said. 'And remind me never to order the port again.'</span></p><span class="quote">He picked you up from your chair and your head rested on his shoulder. 'But why can I not be in love... Oh, carry me carefully on the stairs: I feel sick!'</span></p><span class="quote">'Simply, pet,' he said, walking slowly up the steps. 'What you offer I couldn't accept. In fact, I'm not sure what you are offering. Do you have some fantasy of marrying me? Being my mistress?'</span></p><span class="quote">You could not think of the answer; there was no solution that was not absurd. He set you down carefully on the bed and went away. A moment later he came back, bright crimson bell in his left paw. 'When you wake in the morning and are very ill, which you will be, ring this and the servants will bring a tonic appropriate to your condition.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'For a visit, if you won't go to stay?' he asked. 'We could arrange that too, if you liked.'</span></p><span class="quote">'And nothing bad would happen to anyone I cared about?' you demanded.</span></p><span class="quote">'Nothing bad would happen to you or to your family. There would be no ill health and no spiritual repercussions.'</span></p><span class="quote">'You're leaving something out,' you said, having gotten familiar with the precise way he speaks when hedging around a difficult fact.</span></p><span class="quote">'It could be unpleasant for me,' he replied, strained. 'But you mustn't stay because of my feelings on the matter. Your family miss you, and I am the villain in this piece.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'Don't mention the leaving thing once more,' you said. 'Or I will throw a glass at your head.'</span></p><span class="quote">He sighed. 'You are as stubborn as you are honorable,' he said. 'No doubt the two are related.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;<span class="quote">After a long time: 'You haven't asked me to leave in a while,' you said. </span></p><span class="quote">'Ah.' He looked at his plate of food. 'Of course you may go. I'm glad you believe my word about the effects, now.'</span></p><span class="quote">'I will go to visit my family,' you say, stressing the word visit. 'On condition that you tell me how to do it so that I will not harm you. If you won't do that, I don't go.'</span></p><span class="quote">He looked at you, his expression cloudy. 'There is a very good reason why...'</span></p><span class="quote">'Those are my terms.'</span></p><span class="quote">He sighed. 'Very well,' he said. 'If your trip lasts fewer than seven days, it will have no effect on anything here.' He looked down at his curled paw. 'But if you don't come back -- and I imagine you won't -- I will forgive you.'</span>&quot;</td></tr>
