<tr><td halign="left" valign="top">&quot;<font color=#000080>'You can leave at any time,' he said, when he first spoke to you. You stared at him, surprised that someone with his face and teeth was capable of human communication. 'Would you like to go?'</td></tr>
</font><font color=#000080></table>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>There are other memories, more recent, of course. Every glance around the room reminds you of a different one.</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'I'm surprised you haven't gone home yet,' he said very early in your stay.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I've heard stories,' you replied. 'As if there weren't enough to see around the castle. I know what happens to your servants who try to leave you.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Nothing bad would happen to you,' he said. But you could not believe him, not with all the captured spirits, not with the stories, not with the evidence around the castle.</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'And now -- would you like to go home?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You bit your lip. It had been a pleasant conversation, up until now, when you are reminded: however nicely he may behave, he is still the king of a cursed line, and not to be trusted.</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'I assure you,' he added. 'No harm will come to you if you do go.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I only have your word for that,' you replied, looking stubbornly into your soupbowl.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He sat. 'I am unable to lie to you,' he said. 'It is one of the conditions placed upon us. We can only tell the truth.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'And why should I believe that?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He raised his glass. 'I'll try again tomorrow.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'Were you ever married?' you asked, ignoring his question.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'No.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Then you have no heirs?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I have no legitimate sons,' he replied. 'But I certainly have an heir, somewhere. If I died, somewhere, someone would inherit all this, and the whole system would go on as before, the servants and the contracts. But don't worry: I have tried, and it turns out that I don't die easily.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'And you promise I would not regret it? Truthfully.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He coughed. 'I don't know your future. And -- since you ask I must answer -- I don't think much of your father, a man who would barter his daughter's service for his own, especially since he had unflattering ideas of what I would do with you.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You sputtered. 'Well of course you couldn't-- I mean, being an animal...'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>His teeth gleamed. 'I assure you I could,' he said. 'But I won't.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'I have become used to it here,' you answered, surprising yourself. 'There is plenty to read; there is the chessman, and games; and you are good company.' He raised his glass with a half smile. 'You'd rather stay here without me?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'No,' he said.</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'I c-care for you,' you said. 'I am lonely without you, and you make me laugh, and you're nice...'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Stop,' he said. 'And remind me never to order the port again.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He picked you up from your chair and your head rested on his shoulder. 'But why can I not be in love... Oh, carry me carefully on the stairs: I feel sick!'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Simply, pet,' he said, walking slowly up the steps. 'What you offer I couldn't accept. In fact, I'm not sure what you are offering. Do you have some fantasy of marrying me? Being my mistress?'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>You could not think of the answer; there was no solution that was not absurd. He set you down carefully on the bed and went away. A moment later he came back, bright crimson bell in his left paw. 'When you wake in the morning and are very ill, which you will be, ring this and the servants will bring a tonic appropriate to your condition.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'For a visit, if you won't go to stay?' he asked. 'We could arrange that too, if you liked.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'And nothing bad would happen to anyone I cared about?' you demanded.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Nothing bad would happen to you or to your family. There would be no ill health and no spiritual repercussions.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'You're leaving something out,' you said, having gotten familiar with the precise way he speaks when hedging around a difficult fact.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'It could be unpleasant for me,' he replied, strained. 'But you mustn't stay because of my feelings on the matter. Your family miss you, and I am the villain in this piece.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>'Don't mention the leaving thing once more,' you said. 'Or I will throw a glass at your head.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He sighed. 'You are as stubborn as you are honorable,' he said. 'No doubt the two are related.'</font>&quot;
<br>
&quot;<font color=#000080>After a long time: 'You haven't asked me to leave in a while,' you said. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Ah.' He looked at his plate of food. 'Of course you may go. I'm glad you believe my word about the effects, now.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'I will go to visit my family,' you say, stressing the word visit. 'On condition that you tell me how to do it so that I will not harm you. If you won't do that, I don't go.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He looked at you, his expression cloudy. 'There is a very good reason why...'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>'Those are my terms.'
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>He sighed. 'Very well,' he said. 'If your trip lasts fewer than seven days, it will have no effect on anything here.' He looked down at his curled paw. 'But if you don't come back -- and I imagine you won't -- I will forgive you.'</font>&quot;
