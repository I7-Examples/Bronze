This is necessary because we want the automatic movement to plot a course through areas the player has passed through, whether or not they were dark at the time. Rooms only traversed in darkness are not marked 'visited', so we have to find another way to keep track: 'scouted' means that the player has entered the room at some time or other but may or may not have seen it in the light. Without this restriction, the pathfinder might take the player through rooms not yet explored, which would be less fun; and it might also try to go through off-limits regions.</span></p>
