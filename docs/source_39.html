&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Dependence relates various things to various things. The verb to follow (it follows, they follow, it followed, it is followed, it is following) implies the dependence relation.
<br>

<br>
Before hinting about something which follows something (called the prior issue):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the prior issue is solved, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The current problem cannot be fully dealt with until you have addressed another issue; further exploration is called for[if the prior issue is tantalizing]. You might concentrate on [the prior issue] for now[end if].</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Explaining relates various things to various things. The verb to explain (it explains, they explain, it explained, it is explained, it is explaining) implies the explaining relation.
<br>

<br>
Instead of hinting about something when something unexamined (called the clue) explains the noun:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the clue is the noun, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Try examining [the noun].</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You're still missing some information that might be useful to understanding the problem. [More]</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents, try hinting about the clue.
<br>

<br>
Requiring relates various things to various things. The verb to require (it requires, they require, it required, it is required, it is requiring) implies the requiring relation.
<br>

<br>
Instead of hinting about something when the noun requires something (called the implement) which is not had by the player:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is solved, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the implement is the stool and the stool is visible, continue the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You're missing an object that might be useful to resolving this problem. [More]</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents, try hinting about the implement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Definition: a thing is unsolved:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no.
<br>

<br>
Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>hint</font>&quot; as something new. <font color=#404040><sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup></font>
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hint</font>&quot; as asking for a hint. Asking for a hint is an action out of world. Instead of thinking, try asking for a hint.
<br>

<br>
Carry out asking for a hint: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Beast is unseen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Your goal is to discover the beast; you might try exploring and looking for him. </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the beast is hungry, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You might try finding some food for the Beast. </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;<font color=#000080>The Beast has asked that you destroy the contract book. You could work on that problem, or consider some of the other possibilities. </font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of tantalizing things is greater than 0
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Tantalizing leads at the moment include [the list of tantalizing things].</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the number of unvisited rooms is greater than 0, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Exploring further might be a good idea.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say paragraph break;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a thing is tantalizing:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is solved, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is unseen, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it follows an unsolved thing, no;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is unsolved, yes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
After reading a command:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;<font color=#000080>think</font>&quot;, replace the matched text with &quot;<font color=#000080>hint</font>&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Hinting topically about is an action applying to one topic. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hint about [text]</font>&quot; as hinting topically about.
<br>

<br>
Carry out hinting topically about: say &quot;<font color=#000080>Sorry, there is nothing to say about that.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of hinting topically about a topic listed in the Table of Topic Hints:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[reply entry][paragraph break]</font>&quot;.

<br>

<br>
Instead of hinting about a ringer when the Bellroom is not visited:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>There's a room on the upstairs level that may be relevant to all this.</font>&quot;

Instead of hinting roomily about a room which is controlled by a ringer (called the control):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is solved, continue the action;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] was built for a specific purpose. [more]</font>&quot;;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Something seems unusual about the floor, but you're not able to see what it is. [more]</font>&quot;;

Control relates a thing (called X) to a room (called Y) when Y is the target locale of X. The verb to control (it controls, they control, it controlled, it is controlled, it is controlling) implies the control relation.

<font color=#404040>[This allows us to create the most absolutely generic sort of hint -- boring, perhaps, but in practice the player often just needs a nudge about what part of the game world he should be examining for a solution:</font>]
