The game runs very slightly more slowly in novice mode because it is also calculating what the player might like to do at each turn. It is recommended that the novice player try this for a while, then turn it off when he gets the hang of the command-driven interface. Novice mode does not list every possible command, only those that seem especially obvious or relevant at any given moment.</span>&quot;</td><td>--</td></tr>

I try to get at least three for all but the simplest, smallest pieces. With Bronze, I was aiming at novice-friendliness, and so it was especially important to smooth down the rough edges of the parser and find the places where puzzles were underclued. So I looked for more testers and included some I hadn't worked with before, specifically because I wanted to test with some users who were *not* familiar and comfortable with my writing style. The testing list also includes a mix of more- and less-experienced players, and a range of interests (some are more apt to comment on writing, some on puzzle design, and so on).]</span></p><p class="indent0"> </p><p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Table of Stuckness Advice (continued)</span></p><table><tr><td><span class="columnhead">title</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">subtable</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">description</span></td><td><span class="columnhead">toggle</span></td></tr>
