<br>

<br>
The Drawbridge is a room. &quot;<font color=#000080>[if the Drawbridge is unvisited]Even in your short absence, [the castle] has come to look strange to you again. When you came here first, you stood a long while on the drawbridge, unready to cross [the moat], for fear of the spells that might bind you if you did. This time it is too late to worry about such things[end if][if the Drawbridge is visited]There is little enough purpose in loitering outside: He and his servants never come out here, and whatever you must do, you will have to do within[end if].</font>&quot; The castle exterior is scenery in the drawbridge. The printed name of the castle exterior is &quot;<font color=#000080>castle</font>&quot;. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>tower</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>tower</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>drawbridge</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>bridge</font>&quot; as the castle exterior. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>The drawbridge looks longer than it actually is; the towers are so high that the tops are lost in cloud, and looking east or west, you cannot see the furthest extent of the walls. An optical illusion: it is smaller inside.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Probably.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The iron-barred gate is a door.  &quot;<font color=#000080>An iron-barred gate leads [gate direction].</font>&quot; It is north of the Drawbridge and south of the Entrance Hall. It is closed and openable. Before entering the castle, try entering the gate instead. Before going inside in the Drawbridge, try going north instead. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>door</font>&quot; as the gate.
<br>

<br>
After opening the gate:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You shouldn't be able to open it, heavy as it is, but it swings aside lightly at your touch. The Beast said that it knows friend from enemy; and the castle, at least, still regards you as friend.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The description of the Entrance Hall is &quot;<font color=#000080>There is no fire in the big [fireplace][if the Entrance Hall is unvisited], and no one is waiting for you here[end if]; the air is very cold. Over the gate, the old familiar [warning sign] is painted.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Various passages lead deeper into the castle: north towards the central courtyard, southwest to the guard tower, east and west into the libraries, the offices, the galleries. [if beast is seen]And no wonder he was not here to meet you.[otherwise]Somewhere in this maze, he waits; and he should be told as soon as possible that you did return.[end if]</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Before going outside in the Entrance Hall, try going south instead.
<br>

<br>
The fireplace is scenery in the Entrance Hall. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>Unlit, vacant[if Search is happening]. It is almost as though you are not expected[end if].</font>&quot; The sound of the fireplace is &quot;<font color=#000080>whistling wind</font>&quot;. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>fire</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>whistling</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>wind</font>&quot; as the fireplace. Instead of burning the fireplace: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is no fuel prepared for a fire.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The warning sign is scenery in the Entrance Hall. The description of the warning sign is &quot;<font color=#000080>You know the words by heart, having heard them first from your father, and then studied them yourself on many more recent occasions.</font>&quot; The printing of the sign is &quot;<font color=#000080>Those who seek to leave the castle depart at peril of their lives and souls, unless another servant be provided in exchange, or a fixed term of absence be granted by their master.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>old</font>&quot; or &quot;<font color=#000080>familiar</font>&quot; as the sign.
