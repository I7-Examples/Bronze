The walls, and the ceiling too, are deep scarlet, the color of the old king and queen that ruled here two hundred fifty years ago, when there was still a kingdom.</span>&quot;  </p><p class="indent0">The Scarlet Tower is southeast of the Scarlet Gallery. &quot;<span class="quote">A little hexagonal room, from whose [</span><span class="substitution">narrow window</span><span class="quote">] you can see the moat, the lawn, and the beginning of the forest outside.</span>&quot; The narrow window is scenery in the Scarlet Tower. The outdoors is scenery in the Scarlet Tower. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">moat</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">lawn</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">forest</span>&quot; as the outdoors. The description of the outdoors is &quot;<span class="quote">Beyond a short stretch of clear ground, the forest grows thick and uninhabited for many miles.</span>&quot; Instead of searching the narrow window, try examining the outdoors. The description of the narrow window is &quot;<span class="quote">It gives a view of the forest beyond: the way you came from, in fact.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The helmet is a wearable thing in the Scarlet Tower. &quot;<span class="quote">On the windowsill, [</span><span class="substitution">a helmet</span><span class="quote">] waits, for the use of the sentry.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">very old helmet</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">writing</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">helm</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">lines</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">lines of writing</span>&quot; as the helmet. The description of the helmet is &quot;<span class="quote">A very old helmet that you have seen the Beast wear (and quite foolish it looked, perched on a head it no longer fits: it would suit your head better). He told you once that the helmet was for night watchmen, scouts, and guards, to increase their vigilance and strengthen their hearing.</span>&quot; The printing of the helmet is &quot;<span class="quote">I call upon you, I summon you, I bind you, daemon of the small bone of the left ear: make my hearing strong. I call upon, summon, and bind you, daemon of the small bone of the right ear: make my hearing stronger yet. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">I call upon, I summon, I bind you, daemon of air-that-moves, carry sound swiftly to my ears.

The cage is scenery. It is lockable and locked. It is transparent.

The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Made of broad strap-like bars of metal, as thick as a man's belt, and heavily reinforced. Here and there are marks where someone would seem to have made an attempt to break in[</span><span class="substitution">if the cage contains something</span><span class="quote">].

The sceptre is a reminder. The description of the sceptre is &quot;<span class="quote">Studded with measly turquoises and semi-precious stones.</span>&quot; The memory of the sceptre is &quot;<span class="quote">Formerly belonging to Queen Ingratitudina the First (so he said), only slightly bent where she used it to strike King Cophetua.</span>&quot; The printed name of the jagged piece is &quot;<span class="quote">puzzle piece</span>&quot;. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">puzzle piece</span>&quot; as the jagged piece.</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">scepter</span>&quot; as the sceptre. The description of the jagged piece is &quot;<span class="quote">Something shiny has been painted on the piece.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The pair of cloven shoes is a thing in the iron cage. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Made for something with cloven hoofs[</span><span class="substitution">if the shoes are wearable</span><span class="quote">], but so large that you could wear them as a kind of awkward sandal[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]. They bear evidence of having been adjusted to their current size by a shoemaker, and perhaps (therefore) could be again.</span>&quot; Instead of wearing the shoes when the shoes are not wearable: say &quot;<span class="quote">They emphatically do not fit. You will have to find someone to adjust them, evidently.</span>&quot; After wearing the shoes: say &quot;<span class="quote">You slip your feet into the shoes, and feel less alone. Mere sentiment, you think; but then there is the brush of a thought other than your own. [</span><span class="substitution">italic type</span><span class="quote">]The crypt. Under the Law Library. There are sources of power there which even I have never understood[</span><span class="substitution">roman type</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; The pair of shoes is ambiguously plural. <a name="note2ref"></a><span class="notecue"><a href="#note2">[2]</a></span></p><p class="indent0">Understand the command &quot;<span class="quote">adjust</span>&quot; as something new. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">adjust [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as fitting. Fitting is an action applying to one thing. Carry out fitting something: say &quot;<span class="quote">There's no useful way for you to adjust [</span><span class="substitution">the noun</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of fitting the shoes, say &quot;<span class="quote">You need a skilled shoemaker for this job.</span>&quot; Instead of fitting the helmet, say &quot;<span class="quote">An armorer you are not, but fortunately none is needed.</span>&quot; Instead of fitting a wearable thing, say &quot;<span class="quote">You've never considered yourself an expert at fitting any kind of clothing.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Maze Room is east of the Gallery of Historical Paintings. The description of the Maze Room is &quot;<span class="quote">A [</span><span class="substitution">labyrinth</span><span class="quote">] of black and white, like that of cathedrals, as protection against the spite of the undead: which protection might often have been needed, by those that dwelt here in former times. The way down is at the center of the maze.</span>&quot; The printed name of the Maze Room is &quot;<span class="quote">Room with the Labyrinth Floor</span>&quot;. </p><p class="indent0">The labyrinth is a floor in the maze room. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">maze</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">mosaic</span>&quot; or  &quot;<span class="quote">tiles</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">tiled</span>&quot; as the labyrinth. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">floor</span>&quot; as the labyrinth when the location is the Maze Room. The description of the labyrinth is &quot;<span class="quote">The maze doesn't look uncrossable by you. You step forward and look down into the room below[</span><span class="substitution">if the candle is in the Bear Corridor</span><span class="quote">], and get the dim impression of light and carved animals[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">], but it is too dark to see much[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; The printed name of the labyrinth is &quot;<span class="quote">mosaic floor</span>&quot;. Instead of solving the maze, say &quot;<span class="quote">It is not a difficult maze at all: a simple inward spiral with a few doublings-back. Spirits must be exceptionally unintelligent.</span>&quot; Before entering the labyrinth, try going down instead.</p><p class="indent0">The Bear Corridor is below the Maze. The Corridor is dark. &quot;<span class="quote">Less couth and cultivated than any other part of the castle, and you have been forbidden to visit this place before now. The walls press close to you on either side. The floor slopes down. Bears with sharp claws are carved into the rock, but they remind you of Him, and you are not frightened.</span>&quot; The carved bears are scenery in the bear corridor. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">bear</span>&quot; as the carved bears. The description of the bears is &quot;<span class="quote">Almost a ceremonial bear procession, if bears had liturgies and rituals.</span>&quot; Instead of going down in Bear Corridor, try going northwest.</p><p class="indent0">The Zoo is northwest of the Bear Corridor. The Zoo is dark. &quot;<span class="quote">A resting place for an animal: warm but rough. There is little to suggest, from this environment, that he thinks of himself as a man at all, though he is capable of walking upright and eating with utensils, of reading books and even of writing a legible hand. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The only distinguishing mark is [</span><span class="substitution">a miniature</span><span class="quote">] hung on the wall, like a devotional object, or perhaps a reminder[</span><span class="substitution">if the royal portrait is seen</span><span class="quote">]. Something about the sole image in an otherwise bare room reminds you of the royal portrait in the Green Bedroom[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; </p><p class="indent0">The miniature is scenery in the Zoo. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">The tiny image of a lady in a green girdle. But it isn't Lucrezia.</span>&quot; Instead of taking or pushing or pulling or turning the miniature: say &quot;<span class="quote">It fails to move even a little, but clings to its place tenaciously -- in the way you associate with the stone gargoyle, upstairs.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The poison vial is a reminder in the Zoo. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">It has mostly dried up now; the apothecary who sold it to you did not say anything about whether it would keep its efficacy for long.</span>&quot; The memory of the poison vial is &quot;<span class="quote">You brought it with you; he confiscated it the first night.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'It was a good thought,' he said, plucking it from your fingers with a delicacy that should be impossible in one his size. 'But if I could be killed by poison -- or by violence, or starving, or leaping from towers, by drowning or by suffocation or by fire, I assure you, I would have found the way by now. That leaves only yourself as a victim, and I did not bring you here to die.' And so you didn't.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of hinting about a reminder, say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">memory of the noun</span><span class="quote">]</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But it is only a token of things past, for which you can come up with no present use.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of eating or drinking the poison vial, say &quot;<span class="quote">That urge, if you ever had it, is gone.</span>&quot;</p>

<p><span class="notesheading">Notes</span></p>
<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  Originally I just had the description, but so many players wanted to know what exactly the helmet said that I introduced a separate text and distinguished READ from EXAMINE. The text itself owes a thing or two to John Gager's work in Curse Tablets and Binding Spells of the Ancient World.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  'Ambiguously plural' is defined in the Plurality extension, and it applies to items that the player might equally call 'it' (as a pair of shoes is an it) or 'them' (as shoes generically are them). This causes both pronouns to be updated.</span></p>
