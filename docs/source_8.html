You have never seen the courtyard otherwise: it rains in every season, winter or summer, no matter what lies beyond the moat.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if the Courtyard is unvisited</span><span class="quote">]It was here that you first laid eyes on the Beast: emerging from the State Rooms, snarling. He seemed angry at you for coming, even though you had had no choice. Or perhaps (you thought) he was simply violent. You did not run.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">]The castle proper opens both north and south, and to the east a helical [</span><span class="substitution">staircase view</span><span class="quote">] ascends to the roof.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The staircase view is a view in the Courtyard. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">A handsome staircase designed by an Italian engineer in the 16th century.</span>&quot; The printed name of staircase view is &quot;<span class="quote">staircase</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of facing east in the Courtyard, try examining the staircase view.</p><p class="indent0">The Ground Floor Helical Staircase is east of the Courtyard. &quot;<span class="quote">The [</span><span class="substitution">steps</span><span class="quote">] rise from here towards the upper rooms, and open out onto the bare courtyard.</span>&quot; <span class="comment">[The courtyard view is a view in the Ground Floor. Understand &quot;bare&quot; as the courtyard view. The description is &quot;[if something is in the courtyard]You can see that some things have been left there, but would have to go closer to look at them[otherwise]It's pretty empty, all right[end if].&quot; The printed name of the courtyard view is &quot;courtyard&quot;.]</span></p><p class="indent0">The obscene gargoyle is a reminder in the Ground Floor Helical Staircase. It is fixed in place. &quot;<span class="quote">An [</span><span class="substitution">obscene gargoyle</span><span class="quote">] sits where the finial of the banister should be.</span>&quot; The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Not too large, but stunningly ugly: a stone about the size of an apple, carved into a monster with outsized ears and eyes -- not to mention outsized attributes elsewhere.</span>&quot; The memory of the obscene gargoyle is &quot;<span class="quote">He came up while you were bent over the gargoyle, trying to lift it. 'Taking that back to your room?' he asked slyly. 'It won't work, but if you're lacking companionship I could find an appropriate servant to see to your needs.'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You felt yourself blush. 'It's ugly,' you said. 'I wanted to move it.'</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">'Oh. You can't.' He frowned at it. 'It is a remnant, left here by an angry soul who managed to take some revenge despite his enslavement. There are a few others around, mostly in the crypt. They're immovable, but harmless.'</span>&quot; Instead of taking or pushing or pulling or turning the gargoyle: say &quot;<span class="quote">It still doesn't budge, and -- you rather think -- it never will.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Upstairs Helical Staircase is above the steps. &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">if the location is unvisited</span><span class="quote">]In this spot, you fell and almost broke your leg -- or some other more valuable part of you -- except that He caught you.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But you are alone now, and therefore cautious[</span><span class="substitution">otherwise</span><span class="quote">]A dizzying prospect, the spiral of [</span><span class="substitution">steps</span><span class="quote">] down to the ground[</span><span class="substitution">end if</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Some steps are above Ground Floor Helical Staircase. The steps are scenery. Understand &quot;<span class="quote">banister</span>&quot; as the steps. The steps are a staircase. The description of the steps is &quot;<span class="quote">Too narrow for comfort near the axis; too broad for speed, along the outer edge; and at the center, where they have just the right breadth, they have been worn down by the passage of hundreds of feet, and made almost into a ramp.</span>&quot;</p>
