<br>
The Central Courtyard is north of the Entrance Hall. &quot;<font color=#000080>Open to a grey sky, from which a light [rain] falls. You have never seen the courtyard otherwise: it rains in every season, winter or summer, no matter what lies beyond the moat.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>[if the Courtyard is unvisited]It was here that you first laid eyes on the Beast: emerging from the State Rooms, snarling. He seemed angry at you for coming, even though you had had no choice. Or perhaps (you thought) he was simply violent. You did not run.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>[end if]The castle proper opens both north and south, and to the east a helical [staircase view] ascends to the roof.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The staircase view is a view in the Courtyard. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>A handsome staircase designed by an Italian engineer in the 16th century.</font>&quot; The printed name of staircase view is &quot;<font color=#000080>staircase</font>&quot;.
<br>

<br>
Instead of facing east in the Courtyard, try examining the staircase view.
<br>

<br>
The Ground Floor Helical Staircase is east of the Courtyard. &quot;<font color=#000080>The [steps] rise from here towards the upper rooms, and open out onto the bare courtyard.</font>&quot; <font color=#404040>[The courtyard view is a view in the Ground Floor. Understand &quot;bare&quot; as the courtyard view. The description is &quot;<font color=#404040>[if something is in the courtyard</font>]You can see that some things have been left there, but would have to go closer to look at them<font color=#404040>[otherwise</font>]It's pretty empty, all right<font color=#404040>[end if</font>].&quot;<font color=#000080> The printed name of the courtyard view is </font>&quot;courtyard&quot;<font color=#000080>.]

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The obscene gargoyle is a reminder in the Ground Floor Helical Staircase. It is fixed in place. </font>&quot;An <font color=#404040>[obscene gargoyle</font>] sits where the finial of the banister should be.&quot;<font color=#000080> The description is </font>&quot;Not too large, but stunningly ugly: a stone about the size of an apple, carved into a monster with outsized ears and eyes -- not to mention outsized attributes elsewhere.&quot;<font color=#000080> The memory of the obscene gargoyle is </font>&quot;He came up while you were bent over the gargoyle, trying to lift it. 'Taking that back to your room?' he asked slyly. 'It won't work, but if you're lacking companionship I could find an appropriate servant to see to your needs.'
<br>

<br>
You felt yourself blush. 'It's ugly,' you said. 'I wanted to move it.'
<br>

<br>
'Oh. You can't.' He frowned at it. 'It is a remnant, left here by an angry soul who managed to take some revenge despite his enslavement. There are a few others around, mostly in the crypt. They're immovable, but harmless.'&quot;<font color=#000080> Instead of taking or pushing or pulling or turning the gargoyle: say </font>&quot;It still doesn't budge, and -- you rather think -- it never will.&quot;<font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The Upstairs Helical Staircase is above the steps. </font>&quot;<font color=#404040>[if the location is unvisited</font>]In this spot, you fell and almost broke your leg -- or some other more valuable part of you -- except that He caught you.

</font><font color=#000080>Some steps are above Ground Floor Helical Staircase. The steps are scenery. Understand </font>&quot;banister&quot;<font color=#000080> as the steps. The steps are a staircase. The description of the steps is </font>&quot;Too narrow for comfort near the axis; too broad for speed, along the outer edge; and at the center, where they have just the right breadth, they have been worn down by the passage of hundreds of feet, and made almost into a ramp.&quot;<font color=#000080>
